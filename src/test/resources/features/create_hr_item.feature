Feature: Create an HR Item 
	As a Human Review API User, 
	I want to create an HR item  
	so that an Analyst can work on the item.
	

#Scenario: Create an HR item successfully with minimal information 
#	Given I have the following HR item to be reviewed: 
#		| field name        | field value   														 | 
#		| Short_Description | Single Indicator: NCCIC:Indicator-f83b16c8-f32a-41d3-8d02-93ad0d37016f |
#	When I create this HR item 
#	Then I should be able to retrieve it.
